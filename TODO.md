# GraphRAG API - Project TODO

## Status: SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-02

## Architecture Simplification ✅

The project has been successfully simplified from an enterprise-scale architecture to a lightweight, small-scale deployment optimized for 1-5 users.

### Completed Transformations

#### Database Layer ✅
- [x] Replaced PostgreSQL with SQLite
- [x] Removed Alembic migrations
- [x] Created simple database manager
- [x] Implemented WAL mode for better concurrency

#### Caching Layer ✅
- [x] Replaced Redis with in-memory cache
- [x] Implemented TTL and statistics
- [x] Made cache optional and configurable

#### Deployment ✅
- [x] Replaced Kubernetes with Cloud Run
- [x] Created optimized Dockerfile for serverless
- [x] Simplified docker-compose for local dev
- [x] Created one-command deployment script

#### Documentation ✅
- [x] Created Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- [x] Consolidated README files
- [x] Updated deployment guides
- [x] Created migration guide

#### Code Cleanup ✅
- [x] Removed v2 route suffixes
- [x] Deleted PostgreSQL-related files
- [x] Cleaned up configuration
- [x] Simplified imports

## Current Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: SQLite (zero configuration)
- **Cache**: In-memory (no Redis needed)
- **LLM Local**: Ollama with Gemma 2B
- **LLM Cloud**: Google Gemini Flash
- **Deployment**: Docker locally, Cloud Run production
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Pydantic

### Key Features
- GraphRAG integration with workspace management
- Multi-provider LLM support
- REST API with OpenAPI documentation
- Simple JWT authentication
- Health check endpoints

## Deployment Checklist

### Local Development
- [ ] Clone repository
- [ ] Copy `env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Run `docker-compose up`
- [ ] Access API at http://localhost:8001

### Production (Cloud Run)
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud project
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Run `./scripts/deploy-cloudrun.sh`
- [ ] Test deployed API

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### If Scaling Beyond 5 Users
1. Migrate to PostgreSQL (migration guide available)
2. Add Redis for distributed caching
3. Implement horizontal scaling
4. Add comprehensive monitoring

### Feature Additions
- [ ] GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates
- [ ] Advanced RBAC if needed
- [ ] Batch processing for large documents
- [ ] Export to additional formats

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review and update documentation
- [ ] Monitor Cloud Run costs
- [ ] Check for GraphRAG library updates

### As Needed
- [ ] Add new LLM providers
- [ ] Optimize for specific use cases
- [ ] Performance tuning if needed

## Project Philosophy

This project follows the principle of **"Simplicity First"**:
- Optimize for small-scale deployment
- Minimize operational complexity
- Quick deployment (< 5 minutes)
- Cost-effective for 1-5 users
- Clear upgrade path if needed
