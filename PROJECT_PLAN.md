3. **Implement basic GraphQL resolvers**
4. **Add GraphQL testing framework**
5. **Create GraphQL playground integration**

## Conclusion

The project has made excellent progress on the REST API side but needs significant work on the GraphQL
interface to achieve the main goal. The revised plan prioritizes GraphQL implementation while maintaining
the quality and completeness established in the REST API.
