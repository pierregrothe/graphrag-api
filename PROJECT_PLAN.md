# GraphRAG API Service - Project Plan

## Project Overview

Building a comprehensive FastAPI-based service for Microsoft GraphRAG with multi-provider LLM support
(local Ollama + Google Cloud Gemini).

## Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Provider LLM Support

**Decision Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Decision**: Implement dual LLM provider support for flexibility and different deployment scenarios.

**Providers**:

- **Ollama (Local)**: Gemma3:4b model for privacy-focused, cost-effective local deployments
- **Google Cloud Gemini**: gemini-2.5-flash/pro for cloud-based, high-performance deployments

**Benefits**:

- Development flexibility (local vs cloud)
- Cost optimization options
- Privacy control (local processing)
- Scalability options (cloud resources)

### Implementation Strategy

**Approach**: Small incremental steps with validation and testing at each phase.

**Validation Requirements**:

- Configuration changes must pass pytest validation
- Each provider integration tested independently
- API endpoints validated with both providers
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
