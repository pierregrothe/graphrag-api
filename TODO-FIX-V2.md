# GraphRAG API Service - TODO and Fix Plan V2

**Generated Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Project Status:** Phase 2 Partially Complete (Despite README Claims)

This updated document reflects the ACTUAL state of the codebase after examining recent modifications. The README claims Phase 2 and 3 are complete, but code analysis reveals significant gaps.

## Executive Summary

The project has **sophisticated architecture** with database models, connection pooling, and GraphQL DataLoader implementation. However, critical components still use mock/in-memory implementations despite infrastructure being in place.

## CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES (README vs Reality)

### README Claims

- ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Database-backed authentication
- ✅ Phase 3 Complete: 93% test pass rate (342 passing tests)
- ✅ Real database connection pooling
- ✅ Complete v2 API implementation

### Actual State

- ❌ JWT auth uses in-memory dict (line 315 `jwt_auth.py`)
- ❌ Graph endpoint tests failing (4/4 failures)
- ⚠️ Connection pooling exists but creates mock connections
- ⚠️ v2 routes have undefined variables and mock responses

## Phase 0: IMMEDIATE FIXES (Production Blockers)

**These must be fixed before ANY production deployment:**

### Task 0.1: Fix Undefined Variables in v2 Routes

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Fix undefined `settings` in `graph_v2.py` lines 64-68
- [ ] Import settings from config module
- [ ] Ensure all v2 routes have proper imports
- [ ] **Location:** `src/graphrag_api_service/routes/graph_v2.py`

### Task 0.2: Complete JWT Database Integration

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Replace in-memory user store at line 315 in `jwt_auth.py`
- [ ] Implement actual database queries using existing User model
- [ ] Update authenticate_user to query database
- [ ] Update create_user to insert into database
- [ ] **Location:** `src/graphrag_api_service/auth/jwt_auth.py`

```python
# Current (line 315):
self.users: dict[str, dict[str, Any]] = {}  # In-memory user store

# Should be:
# Use self.database_manager to query User table
```

### Task 0.3: Fix API Key Admin Check

- [ ] Implement TODO at line 212 in `api_keys.py`
- [ ] Add proper role checking from database
- [ ] **Location:** `src/graphrag_api_service/auth/api_keys.py`

## Phase 1: Complete Database Integration

### Task 1.1: Wire Database to Authentication

- [ ] Modify AuthenticationService constructor to accept DatabaseManager
- [ ] Replace all dictionary operations with database queries
- [ ] Test user persistence across restarts
- [ ] Verify token generation with database users

### Task 1.2: Complete v2 Route Implementation

- [ ] Remove mock responses from graph_v2.py (lines 267-302)
- [ ] Implement real graph operations instead of empty returns
- [ ] Fix workspace_id parameter handling
- [ ] Ensure GraphOperationsDep is properly injected

### Task 1.3: Fix Connection Pool Cache

- [ ] Implement real caching in connection_pool.py (line 361)
- [ ] Integrate with Redis cache manager
- [ ] Remove "return None" placeholder
- [ ] Add proper cache key generation

## Phase 2: Testing and Validation

### Task 2.1: Fix Failing Tests

- [ ] Fix 4 failing graph endpoint tests
- [ ] Resolve dependency injection issues in tests
- [ ] Update test fixtures for database integration
- [ ] Verify claimed 93% pass rate

### Task 2.2: Add Database Integration Tests

- [ ] Test user persistence
- [ ] Test workspace database operations
- [ ] Test connection pooling with real database
- [ ] Test cache hit/miss scenarios

## Phase 3: Remove Mock Implementations

### Task 3.1: Eliminate Mock Connections

- [ ] Remove `_create_mock_connection` method
- [ ] Ensure all connections use real database
- [ ] Update fallback behaviors to throw errors instead of mocking

### Task 3.2: Complete Cache Implementation

- [ ] Replace placeholder cache methods
- [ ] Integrate with Redis for distributed caching
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies

## Phase 4: Documentation Alignment

### Task 4.1: Update README

- [ ] Correct Phase 2 completion claims
- [ ] Update test coverage statistics with actual numbers
- [ ] Document what's actually implemented vs planned
- [ ] Add "Known Limitations" section

### Task 4.2: Add Migration Guide

- [ ] Document how to migrate from file-based to database
- [ ] Provide SQL scripts for initial data load
- [ ] Document backup and restore procedures

## Priority Matrix

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Effort | Risk |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|------|
| P0 | Undefined settings variable | App won't start | Low | HIGH |
| P0 | In-memory auth storage | Data loss on restart | Medium | HIGH |
| P1 | Mock responses in v2 | Feature incomplete | Medium | MEDIUM |
| P1 | Failing tests | Unknown bugs | Medium | MEDIUM |
| P2 | Mock connections | Performance impact | Low | LOW |
| P3 | Documentation mismatch | User confusion | Low | LOW |

## Code Locations Reference

### Critical Files to Modify

1. **`jwt_auth.py:315`** - Replace in-memory user dict
2. **`graph_v2.py:64-68`** - Fix undefined settings
3. **`api_keys.py:212`** - Implement admin check
4. **`connection_pool.py:361`** - Implement real caching
5. **`graph_v2.py:267-302`** - Remove mock responses

### Database Models (Already Exist)

- `src/graphrag_api_service/database/models.py` ✅
- User, Role, APIKey, Workspace models ✅
- Alembic migrations ✅

### Working Components

- GraphQL DataLoader ✅
- Database schema ✅
- Connection pool structure ✅
- Dependency injection ✅

## Validation Checklist

Before claiming "Production Ready":

- [ ] All tests pass (currently failing)
- [ ] No in-memory data storage
- [ ] No mock responses in production code
- [ ] Settings properly imported everywhere
- [ ] Database persistence verified
- [ ] Cache implementation complete
- [ ] Admin authorization working
- [ ] Documentation matches reality

## Recommended Approach

1. **Fix P0 issues first** - App won't work without these
2. **Complete database integration** - Critical for data persistence
3. **Fix tests** - Verify nothing else is broken
4. **Remove mocks** - Clean up technical debt
5. **Update documentation** - Align with reality

## Time Estimate

- Phase 0: 1-2 days (Critical fixes)
- Phase 1: 3-5 days (Database integration)
- Phase 2: 2-3 days (Testing)
- Phase 3: 1-2 days (Cleanup)
- Phase 4: 1 day (Documentation)

**Total: 8-13 days to reach actual "Production Ready" state**

## Notes

The codebase has excellent architecture and patterns. The database schema is well-designed, and the GraphQL DataLoader implementation is professional. However, the integration between components is incomplete, and critical sections still use placeholders or mock implementations.

The project would benefit from:

1. Completing the existing implementations rather than adding new features
2. Comprehensive integration testing
3. Honest documentation about current limitations
4. A clear migration path from file-based to database storage
