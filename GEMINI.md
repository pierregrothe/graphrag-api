# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a FastAPI-based API for the `microsoft/graphrag` library. The project is inspired by the backend of `severian42/GraphRAG-Local-UI`, but will be a fresh implementation focusing solely on the API.

## Key Decisions

* **Dependency Management:** We will use Poetry for dependency management and environment setup, as recommended by the `microsoft/graphrag` documentation.
* **Project Structure:** The project will follow a standard Python project structure, with the source code located in a `src` directory.
* **Version Control:** The project is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/pierregrothe/graphrag-api](https://github.com/pierregrothe/graphrag-api).
* **Documentation:** The `README.md` file will be the main source of documentation and will include Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the architecture. This `GEMINI.md` file will be updated with key decisions made during the development process.

## Building and Running

**TODO:** Add instructions on how to build, run, and test the project.

## Development Conventions

**TODO:** Add any coding styles, testing practices, or contribution guidelines.
